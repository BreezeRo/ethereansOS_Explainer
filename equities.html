                    <h2>Equities of protocols on top of Ethereum</h2>
                    <p>These are the voting tokens for On-Chain Organizations. They are like private equities, and award exclusive ownership of the protocol and its assets.</p>
                    <p>Holders are like a traditional company’s shareholders, but only they are the company. Centralized management teams are redundant.</p>
                    <p>ETH-Equity holders can vote edit functions and the frontend: change governance rules; update DFO cores; manage DFO wallet funds; organize and implement DeFi investment strategies; etc.</p>
                    <p>The difference in terms of governance between DAOs approaches and the DFOs approach is that in DAOs, the DAO code owner is an external entity, so token holders have just the ownership inside a fixed box of rules managed by a company or a team. </p>

                    <p>Programmable Equities of DFOs/ECOs are the equities that own the code of DAOs and Dapps functions, basically replacing the needs of an off-chain company and its equities.</p>
                    <h5>ethOS ($BUIDL, $UniFi and $ARTE) Equities</h5>
                    <p>The three main On-chain Organizations that empower the ethereansOS are:</p>
                    <p>Buidl: ETH-Equity of DFOhub</p>
                    <p>UniFi: ETH-Equity Equity of UniFi (Portals)</p>
                    <p>Arte: ETH-Equity Equity of Items</p>
                    <p>Names are currently misleading. We're facing a rebrand, and once the ECO is completed, the token names will reflect the Organizations names.</p>
                    <p>All of these three tokens have the right to manage their On-Chain organization, without any possibility of add functionalities, update functionalities or manage assets without a proposal and the acceptance based on the governance rules with these tokens.</p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p>If the NERV team loses its tokens, they will no longer work on the protocol and its features.</p>

                    <p><b>Inflation:</b></p>
                    <p>The inflation of Buidl, UniFi, and arte are made by its 50% between the two main actors:</p>
                    <p>The public entities (DFOhub, UniFi, and arte) and the private entity NERV using Liquidity Mining and Fixed Inflation mechanism.</p>
                    <p>The public entities are designed to be managed by holders, making choices based on holders' prospects and interests.</p>
                    <p>The inflation of the public entities (divided from the Fixed Inflation and Liquidity Mining) are designed to incentive holders to constantly add liquidity in selected AMMs tier (Liquidity Mining) and constantly increase the treasury for community-driven investments and backup of the Programmable Equities.</p>
                    <p>The private entity's inflation is based on paying expenses and invest in work needed on the future of protocol reaching the 1.0.</p>
                    <p>$BUIDL, $UniFi & $ARTE are currently being inflated by Fixed Inflation and seasonal farming, the latter of which accounts for 40% of potential inflation (depends how much liquidity is mined).</p>
                    <p>If 100% of all farming pools are filled, the total possible yearly collective inflation is 401.5K $ARTE; 600K $BUIDL; and 1.868M $UniFi.</p>
                    <p>Until UniFi becomes Portals and the new farming contracts are released, farming seasons for the three tokens are short-term, with higher rewards than usual to ensure incentivized liquidity provision following the <a href="https://unimergency.dfohub.com">Unimergency Dilemma</a>.</p>

                    <p>With the ECO relese, DFOs tokens will be switchable to ITEM-based tokens with no time limit at a 1:1 ratio.</p>
                    <p>Following the release of ECOs, holders and the NERV ECO will jointly conduct inflation for these three core ethOS ECOs.</p>
